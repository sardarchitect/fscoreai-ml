# ML Implementation From Scratch
## Overview
This repo serves as a resource for anyone wanting to learn implementation of basic machine learning algorithms from scratch using vanilla Python. Note: the word "vanilla" is being used loosely. The repo does use certain libraries like NumPy that assist with numerical computation. 

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into separate directories for each machine learning algorithm, with each directory containing Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts dedicated to the implementation of the specific algorithm. The following algorithms are currently covered:
1. Generalized Linear Models 
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Decision Trees
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Neural Networks

For each algorithm,  detailed explanations, mathematical derivations, and algorithmic walkthroughs have been provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy 1.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-algorithms.git 
cd machine-learning-algorithms
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy jupyter
```

### Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, navigate to the desired algorithm directory and open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook.

## Implementation and Learning
The implementation of each algorithm is done using only vanilla Python and NumPy, emphasizing the underlying mathematical concepts. Participants are encouraged to follow along with the Jupyter Notebooks, modify code snippets, experiment with hyperparameters, and visualize results to deepen their understanding.

## Real-World Datasets
To apply the developed algorithms in practical scenarios, we provide real-world datasets within each algorithm's directory. Participants will learn how to preprocess and transform data, split it into training and testing sets, and evaluate their implementations on diverse datasets.

## Performance Comparison
To gain insights into the strengths and limitations of handcrafted implementations, we also include comparisons against well-established machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. This comparison helps participants understand the advantages and trade-offs of using vanilla Python and NumPy.
