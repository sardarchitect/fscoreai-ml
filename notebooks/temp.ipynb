    "An alternative view of finding the optimized parameters is to think about the probabilistic method that might have generated our data (as a conditional probability distribution). This procedure must have had some parameters that we could estimate to try and re-generate the data. \n",

    "### Data\n",
    "Let's say we are given a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{\\left(x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}\\right),\\dots,\\left(x^{(n)}, y^{(n)}\\right)\\right\\}$, where $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is an independent variable, while $y^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a dependent variable that follows a normal distribution over all $X$. This means tha at every $x^{(i)}$, there is a $y^{(i)}$ following a normal distribution defined by an independent and fixed standard deviation $\\sigma$, and a $X$-dependent and variable coefficient $\\theta$. Mathematically, $$y^{(i)}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(y^{(i)}, \\mu=\\theta x^{(i)},\\sigma\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis/Goal\n",
    "We are interested in producing a model that, instead of estimating a single value $\\hat y$, it estimates a conditional distribution $p(Y|X)$. More specifically, we would like to find the parameters $\\theta^*$ that give us the maximum likelihood of observing our training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we assumed that all $y^{(i)}$ follow a univariate Gaussian, we can write the probability as: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Pr}\\left(y^{(i)}|x^{(i)}, \\mu, \\sigma\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left(y^{(i)} - \\theta x^{(i)}\\right)^2\\right)\n",
